Welcome to the Pizza Sales Report project! This repository provides an implementation of a database system designed to manage and generate sales reports for a pizza shop using SQL. The project aims to track pizza orders, calculate revenue, analyze sales data, and generate meaningful insights for business decision-making.

The system involves several SQL tables to store data related to pizza orders, customers, menu items, and more. With the help of SQL queries, the system can generate reports such as total sales, most popular pizzas, customer trends, and daily/weekly/monthly sales summaries.

This project is designed for anyone interested in learning SQL through a real-world example of handling sales data and reporting in a pizza restaurant business.
